# About
We are creating a GUI application in Python using [PyQt5](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5)

# Tutorials and Resources
- https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro is tediously detailed
- http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5 is a much more practical walkthrough


# [Installing PyQt5](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html)
```
brew install python3
sudo pip3 install pyqt5
```

NOTE! You will need to use python3. Your newly installed python3 will likely not be the default when you run `python` and not located under the default `/usr/bin/python`.  See the caveats upon installation. Mine:

```
Python has been installed as
/usr/local/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
    /usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin

If you need Homebrew's Python 2.7 run
brew install python@2

Pip, setuptools, and wheel have been installed. To update them run
pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

You can install Python packages with
pip3 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages

See: https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python
```
